## Hello World

This is my Nth domain/site, but this domain has a specific usage.
This domain is used less for blog hosting and more for mail hosting.
The self serve mail domain was triggered by [[https://www.kylepiira.com/2020/01/09/why-i-quit-google/]]

As of now, I am still using gmail, but its hosted behind a free [[https://improvmx.com/]] domain, such that I can receive emails at this present domain into my gmail inbox.

This domain maybe more suitable for my personal profile going forward now as compared to my other [[domain][blog.hackalyst.info]] so far.
