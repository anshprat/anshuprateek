## Hello World

This is my Nth domain/site, but this domain has a specific usage.
This domain is used less for blog hosting and more for mail hosting.
The self serve mail domain was triggered by [this](https://www.kylepiira.com/2020/01/09/why-i-quit-google/)

As of now, I am still using gmail, but its hosted behind a free [improvmx](https://improvmx.com/) domain, such that I can receive emails at this present domain into my gmail inbox.

This domain maybe more suitable for my personal profile going forward now as compared to my other [domain](https://blog.hackalyst.info) so far.

I will mostly talk about professional / technical pieces on this domain while keeping the non-tech pieces for the other domain for the time being. Can consider merging the two later. Considering the only cost I have to bother about is the domain cost, I can live with it for the time being.
